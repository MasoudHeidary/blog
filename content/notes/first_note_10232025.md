It’s been a long time since I started thinking about having my own blog.
I’d say the biggest barrier was that I really didn’t want to write in HTML or mess with Bootstrap just to fix UI stuff, honestly. As much as I enjoy writing code, I find no pleasure in trying to center a text box on a webpage.

Anyway, I recently started using this tool called Hugo. It’s not perfect, and it took a couple of hours to learn, but it gets the job done.

BUT  
the real reason I started this blog is that I feel writing the things I learn, and trying to express them in words will change the way I think.
I don’t want to look back one day and say, “Yeah, during my doctorate I wrote a few papers, and that was it, and nothing more”. I want something more meaningful, something that has some of my personality in it, rather than just empty words on resume.

And above all, I needed another **MORE** to keep going.
