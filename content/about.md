Hi there, I'm Masoud Heidary, pursuing my degree at the University of Houston and I'm passinate about embedded systems, programming and space exploration.

I grew up fascinated by how technology shapes the world, and I was (and am) envious of Elon Musk (except his political era obviously!). That pushed me to come to the  United States to contribute to making the world a better place. I've always dreamed of looking at Earth from the Moon one day, without imaginary borders drawn on it.

I'm still into sci-fi movies for motivation. They remind me why I started at the first place. "We are part of this universe; We are in this universe", [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/)

This blog is where I share friendly notes, experiments and my ongoing project.

You can find all my open-source projects, experiment code, and prototypes on my GitHub at [github.com/masoudheidary](https://github.com/MasoudHeidary).
